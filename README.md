# autofl (Automated Federated Learning) Python Package

![AutoFL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujaykumarmag/auto-fl/main/fl.png)

## Overview

This Python package provides a set of tools and utilities for implementing Federated Learning (FL) in your machine learning projects. Federated Learning is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models across multiple devices or servers while keeping the data localized.

## Features

- **Federated Aggregation Algorithms:** Implementations of popular aggregation algorithms for federated learning.
- **Secure Communication:** Secure communication protocols to ensure privacy during model updates.
- **Customizable Model Updates:** Easily customize how model updates are aggregated and shared across participants.
- **Supports** Supports both Tensorflow and Pytorch as backends
- **Example Applications:** Included example applications to demonstrate the usage of the package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ autofl
```
